                    Project F (Anthony) is an aspiring electronic musician. The alias “Project F” derives from 2015, the year in which Anthony first started producing music. The number “15” is represented as “F” in hexadecimal base. Influenced by early works of Temple One, Above & Beyond, and ATB, Project F strives to produce electronic music that combines power and elegance. He is in charge of every aspect of music production, and especially enjoys making sounds from scratch, using both recorded samples and synthesizers. To him, this process feels almost like doing mathematics, in which powerful theorems are deduced from simple rules. Project F is constantly learning to expand his choices for creating sounds. He is currently studying signal processing, machine learning, and acoustics to explore new approaches to sound synthesis.
